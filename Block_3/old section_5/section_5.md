## Village

To get accustomed to Babyklon it is suggested to follow through the tutorial on [building a village](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/introductionToFeatures/chap2).

The village is built up in stages so these will be stored in different scenes to record the progression through the code.

The online tutorial includes a range of alternative methods of controlling the appearance of elements, so following through here should not replace reading through the full tutorial in the BabylonJS documentation.
