# Building scenes

To get accustomed to Babyklon it is suggested to follow through the tutorial on [building a village](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/introductionToFeatures/chap2).

The village is built up in stages so it is useful to have scenes which can be switched between to see the development stages.

## Swapping Scenes.

Working locally (not on Docker) a simple way to switch from one scene to another is presented.  This uses HTML buttons which are outside the canvas.  In a subsequent section gui elements will be introduced into the canvas which can have the same effect.
