## Village Environment

To get accustomed to Babyklon this section reflects sections the tutorial [building a village](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/introductionToFeatures/chap2) but is presented in typescript.

The village is built up in stages so these will be stored in different scenes to record the progression through the code.

The online tutorial includes a range of alternative methods of controlling the appearance of elements, so following through here should not replace reading through the full tutorial in the BabylonJS documentation.Select Element 1 from the Elements dropdown menu.

This demonstrates terrain with a height map and sky box.  Some meshes are included reflecting the village tutorial.  Additional trees are placed as sprites.

The suggested file structure for code and assets is shown here.

![structure](/images/structure.png)

The index file links to the index.ts script.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Village Environment</title>
    </head>
    <body> </body>
</html>
<script type="module" src="./src/index.ts"></script>
```

The file **index.ts** runs the scene.

```javascript
import { Engine} from "@babylonjs/core";
import createStartScene from "./createStartScene";
import createRunScene from "./createRunScene";
import "./main.css";

const CanvasName = "renderCanvas";

let canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
canvas.id = CanvasName;

canvas.classList.add("background-canvas");
document.body.appendChild(canvas);

let eng = new Engine(canvas, true, {}, true);
let startScene = createStartScene(eng);
createRunScene(startScene);

eng.runRenderLoop(() => {
  startScene.scene.render();
});
```

First the necessary resources are imported, then a canvas is created in th HTML document object model.

An instance of the bablonjs engine is created and passed as a function to createStartScene(eng) which will create all the elements in the scene and return both the scene and these elements matching the SceneData interface defined in interfaces.d.ts.

The function createRunScene is then called.  This is done so that the visual elements can be described seperately from the scene actions.  In this case the createRunScene content will be minor because there is no action in the scene.

Finally, the scene is rendered within a loop at the default frame rate.

The scene uses assets downloaded from the BabylonJS documentation and the [assets library](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Assets).  The trees are sprites generated by generative AI.

![trees](images/tree.png)

The main content is in **createStartScene.ts**

The file imports the module resources it needs includint the SceneData interface which is maintained to match the scene data set at the end of the createStartScene.ts file.

The import list of babylon core elements is built up gradually as items are added to the code.  

```javascript
import { SceneData } from "./interfaces ";

import {
  Scene,
  ArcRotateCamera,
  Vector3,
  MeshBuilder,
  Mesh,
  StandardMaterial,
  HemisphericLight,
  Color3,
  Engine,
  Texture,
  CubeTexture,
  Nullable,
  Vector4,
  InstancedMesh,
  SpriteManager,
  Sprite
} from "@babylonjs/core";
```

A central square of ground material is prepared to represent grass and has backFaceCulling set to false so that the ground is not transparent when viewed from below.

```javascript
function createGround(scene: Scene) {
  const groundMaterial = new StandardMaterial("groundMaterial");
  groundMaterial.diffuseTexture = new Texture(
    "./assets/environments/valleygrass.png"
  );
  groundMaterial.diffuseTexture.hasAlpha = true;
  //groundMaterial.diffuseColor = new Color3(0, 1, 0);
  groundMaterial.backFaceCulling = false;
  let ground = MeshBuilder.CreateGround(
    "ground",
    { width: 15, height: 15 },
    scene
  );

  ground.material = groundMaterial;
  return ground;
}
```

The ground material is created from a standardMaterial with a diffuse texture added from the valley grass image.

Surrounding ground is create3d using a mesh based on a height map where the lighter material appears as a higher contour.  The affect of the height map is ajusted within the ```{options}```

The largeGround material is then applied to the largeGround mesh.

The mesh is positioned at a small negative y position so that it is not coincident with the central square of ground material.

```javascript
function createTerrain(scene: Scene) {
  const largeGroundMat = new StandardMaterial("largeGroundMat");
  largeGroundMat.diffuseTexture = new Texture(
    "./assets/environments/valleygrass.png"
  );

  const largeGround = MeshBuilder.CreateGroundFromHeightMap(
    "largeGround",
    "./assets/environments/villageheightmap.png",
    {
      width: 150,
      height: 150,
      subdivisions: 20,
      minHeight: 0,
      maxHeight: 10,
      
    },scene
  );
  largeGround.material = largeGroundMat;
  largeGround.position.y = -0.01;
}
```
The scene utilises a skybox based on a series of faces which make up a cube texture.

![skybox](images/skybox.png)

```javascript
function createSky(scene: Scene) {
  const skybox = MeshBuilder.CreateBox("skyBox", { size: 150 }, scene);
  const skyboxMaterial = new StandardMaterial("skyBox", scene);
  skyboxMaterial.backFaceCulling = false;
  skyboxMaterial.reflectionTexture = new CubeTexture(
    "./assets/textures/skybox/skybox",
    scene
  );
  skyboxMaterial.reflectionTexture.coordinatesMode =
    Texture.SKYBOX_MODE;
  skyboxMaterial.diffuseColor = new Color3(0, 0, 0);
  skyboxMaterial.specularColor = new Color3(0, 0, 0);
  skybox.material = skyboxMaterial;
  return skybox;
}
```
A house is based on a two boxes which are decorated with materials for the walls and roof.
The boxes are merged to create a single house and the mergeMeshes parameters are set to allow the use of multiple materials.

The faceUV arrays are set to map points on the image which will represent the corners of faces of the boxes.

By passing a style parameter 1 or 2 the body of the house can be created as a small house or a larger semi-detached pair of houses.

The roof is then created using a cylinder of tessellation value 3 to create a triangular section.

Roof and house body are merged together.

```javascript
function createHouse(scene: Scene, style: number)  {
  //style 1 small style 2 semi detatched
  const boxMat = new StandardMaterial("boxMat");
  const faceUV: Vector4[] = []; // faces for small house
  if (style == 1) {
    boxMat.diffuseTexture = new Texture(
      "./assets/textures/cubehouse.png"
    );
    faceUV[0] = new Vector4(0.5, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0); //rear face
    faceUV[1] = new Vector4(0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 1.0); //front face
    faceUV[2] = new Vector4(0.25, 0, 0.5, 1.0); //right side
    faceUV[3] = new Vector4(0.75, 0, 1.0, 1.0); //left side
    // faceUV[4] would be for bottom but not used
    // faceUV[5] would be for top but not used
  } else {
    boxMat.diffuseTexture = new Texture(
      "./assets/textures/semihouse.png"
    );
    faceUV[0] = new Vector4(0.6, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0); //rear face
    faceUV[1] = new Vector4(0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 1.0); //front face
    faceUV[2] = new Vector4(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1.0); //right side
    faceUV[3] = new Vector4(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1.0); //left side
    // faceUV[4] would be for bottom but not used
    // faceUV[5] would be for top but not used
  }

  const box = MeshBuilder.CreateBox(
    "box",
    { width: style, height: 1, faceUV: faceUV, wrap: true },
    scene
  );
  box.position = new Vector3(0, 0.5, 0);
  box.scaling = new Vector3(1, 1, 1);

  box.material = boxMat;

  const roof = MeshBuilder.CreateCylinder("roof", {
    diameter: 1.3,
    height: 1.2,
    tessellation: 3,
  });
  roof.scaling.x = 0.75;
  roof.scaling.y = style * 0.85;
  roof.rotation.z = Math.PI / 2;
  roof.position.y = 1.22;
  const roofMat = new StandardMaterial("roofMat");
  roofMat.diffuseTexture = new Texture(
    "./assets/textures/roof.jpg",
    scene
  );
  roof.material = roofMat;

  const house = Mesh.MergeMeshes(
    [box, roof],
    true,
    false,
  undefined,
    false,
    true
  );
  // last true allows combined mesh to use multiple materials

  return house;
}
```
A createHouses function is provided to call the singular createHouse function.


If a style parameter is set to 1 then createHouse is passed the parameters to make a single house.

If a style parameter is set to 2 then createHouse is passed the parameters to make a single semi detatched house.

If a style parameter i set to 3 then createHouse is called multiple times with varied parameters to mix semi and detached houses.


 This places two models fiorst and then goes on to place further copies as instances.  The orientation of the houses does not match the original tutorial so the graphic featuring the street at ground level is not used.

 Empty arrays are set up which will hold the house meshes for the two designs, instances of these meshes which will be placed on screen and location and type data to describe the estate layout.

 For each house required an entry is made in the places array which records the house type, rotation and position.

 The two models are saved in the houses array.

 Iterating through the places array, instances of the houses are loaded into the ihouses array and these are placed on screen.

```javascript
function createHouses(scene: Scene, style: number) {
  //Start by locating one each of the two house types then add others

  if (style == 1) {
    // show 1 small house
    createHouse(scene, 1);
  }
  if (style == 2) {
    // show 1 large house
    createHouse(scene, 2);
  }
  if (style == 3) {
    // show estate
    const houses: Nullable<Mesh>[] = [];
    const ihouses: InstancedMesh[] = [];    
    const places: number[][] = []; //each entry is an array [house type, rotation, x, z]
    places.push([1, 0, 0, 1]); // small house
    places.push([2, 0, 2, 1]); // semi  house
    places.push([1, 0, 0, -1]);
    places.push([2, 0, -2, -1]);
    places.push([2, Math.PI / 2, -2.5, 1]);
    places.push([2, -Math.PI / 2, +2.5, -1]);
    places.push([1, Math.PI / 2, -2.5, 3]);
    places.push([1, -Math.PI / 2, +2.5, -3]);

    houses[0] = createHouse(scene, 1);
    houses[1] = createHouse(scene, 2);

    for (let i = 0; i < places.length; i++) {
      if (places[i][0] === 1) {
        ihouses[i] = houses[0]!.createInstance("house" + i);
      } else {
        ihouses[i] = houses[1]!.createInstance("house" + i);
      }
      ihouses[i].rotation.y = places[i][1];
      ihouses[i].position.x = places[i][2];
      ihouses[i].position.z = places[i][3];
    }
  }
  // nothing returned by this function
}
```

Trees are added from 2D images as sprites which always face the camera.  These are arranged randomy in two groves.

```javascript
function createTrees(scene: Scene){
  const spriteManagerTrees = new SpriteManager("treesManager", "./assets/sprites/tree.png", 2000, {width: 512, height: 1024}, scene);

  //We create trees at random positions
  for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
      const tree: Sprite = new Sprite("tree", spriteManagerTrees);
      tree.position.x = Math.random() * (-30);
      tree.position.z = Math.random() * 20 + 8;
      tree.position.y = 0.2;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
      const tree = new Sprite("tree", spriteManagerTrees);
      tree.position.x = Math.random() * (25) + 7;
      tree.position.z = Math.random() * -35  + 8;
      tree.position.y = 0.2;
  }
  // nothing returned by this function
}
```

A hemispheric light is used with a bit of added colour for diffuse, specular and ground surfaces.

```javascript
function createHemisphericLight(scene: Scene) {
  const light = new HemisphericLight(
    "light",
    new Vector3(2, 1, 0), // move x pos to direct shadows
    scene
  );
  light.intensity = 0.7;
  light.diffuse = new Color3(1, 1, 1);
  light.specular = new Color3(1, 0.8, 0.8);
  light.groundColor = new Color3(0, 0.2, 0.7);
  return light;
}
```

An arcRotateCamera is added, but its position and rotation is limitted so that the motion of the camera cannot spoil the appearance of the scene.

```javascript
function createArcRotateCamera(scene: Scene) {
  let camAlpha = -Math.PI / 2,
    camBeta = Math.PI / 2.5,
    camDist = 25,
    camTarget = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
  let camera = new ArcRotateCamera(
    "camera1",
    camAlpha,
    camBeta,
    camDist,
    camTarget,
    scene
  );
  camera.lowerRadiusLimit = 9;
  camera.upperRadiusLimit = 25;
  camera.lowerAlphaLimit = 0;
  camera.upperAlphaLimit = Math.PI * 2;
  camera.lowerBetaLimit = 0;
  camera.upperBetaLimit = Math.PI / 2.02;

  camera.attachControl(true);
  return camera;
}
```
Finally, a createScene function draws the elements together and these are stored into a data structure defined by the SceneData interface.

```javascript
export default function createStartScene(engine: Engine) {
  let scene   = new Scene(engine);
  let ground  = createGround(scene);
  let sky     = createSky(scene);
  let lightHemispheric = createHemisphericLight(scene);
  createHouses(scene, 3);
  createTrees(scene);
  createTerrain(scene);
  let camera  = createArcRotateCamera(scene);


  let that: SceneData = {
    scene,
    ground,
    sky,
    lightHemispheric,
    camera
  };
  return that;
}
```

It is essential that the description of the sceneData in interfaces.d.ts matches the description in createStartScenes perfectly.

**interfaces.d.ts**
```javascript
import {
  Scene,
  Mesh,
  HemisphericLight,
  Camera,
} from "@babylonjs/core";

export interface SceneData {
  scene: Scene;
  ground: Mesh;
  sky: Mesh;
  lightHemispheric: HemisphericLight;
  camera: Camera;
}
```

The file createRunScene is really only a placeholder as there is no action added into this scene.

```javascript
import {} from "@babylonjs/core";

import { SceneData } from "./interfaces ";

export default function createRunScene(runScene: SceneData) {
 

  runScene.scene.onAfterRenderObservable.add(() => {});
}
```

Then with all of this in place the scene will appear as:

<iframe 
    height="600" 
    width="100%" 
    scrolling="no" 
    title="shapes" 
    src="Block_3/section_5/distrib/index.html" 
    frameborder="no" 
    loading="lazy" 
    allowtransparency="true" 
    allowfullscreen="true">
</iframe>
