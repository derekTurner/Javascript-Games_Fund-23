JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. It is among 3 other languages that a web developer must learn:

```HTML
<button style =" width:4em"
onClick = 'if (this.innerText == "OFF"){this.innerText = "ON ";} else {this.innerText = "OFF";}' >OFF</button>
```

<button style =" width:4em" 
onClick = 'if (this.innerText == "OFF"){this.innerText = "ON ";} else {this.innerText = "OFF";}' >OFF</button>
